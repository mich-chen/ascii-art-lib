# Take Home Challenge: ASCII Graphics Library

ASCII art is a term used to describe images that are made of text instead of
pixels. It became a popular genre of art in the 70s-80s, back when computers
could only handle displaying text on the screen. For example:
```
                   ,%%%,
                 ,%%%` %
                ,%%`( '|
               ,%%@ /\_/
     ,%.-"""--%%% "@@__
    %%/             |__`\
   .%'\     |   \   /  //
   ,%' >   .'----\ |  [/
      < <<`       ||
       `\\\       ||
         )\\      )\
 ^^^^^^^^"""^^^^^^""^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 ```
 In this take home challenge, implement a library in the language
 of your choice for drawing ASCII graphics.

## Specifications

You'll be in charge of implementing the API for drawing **rectangles** (and
squares). The API must be able to:

* Render canvas
  * Print the canvas and any shapes to standard output
* Add a shape to a canvas
  * ***shape*** the shape to add. For now, assume you only have to deal
    with rectangles
* Clear all shapes from a canvas
* Create a rectangle
  * ***start_x*** is the X coordinate of the upper-left-hand corner of the
    rectangle
  * ***start_y*** is the Y coordinate of the upper-left-hand corner of the
    rectangle
  * ***end_x*** is the X coordinate of the lower-right-hand corner of the
    rectangle
  * ***end_y*** is the Y coordinate of the lower-right-hand corner of the
    rectangle
  * ***fill_char*** is the character that should be used to draw the
    rectangle
* Change a rectangle's fill character
  * ***char*** the character to use in order to draw a pre-existing
    rectangle
* Translate (move left, right, up, or down)
  * ***axis*** which axis (`'x'` or `'y'`) should we translate the rectangle on?
    Translating on the X-axis will cause the rectangle to move left
    and right. Translating on the Y-axis will cause the rectangle to
    move up and down.
  * ***num*** is how much to move the rectangle. Negative numbers will
    cause the rectangle to shift left or down. Positive numbers will cause
    the rectangle to shift right or up.

For now, assume that you're always working with a 10-by-10 character canvas
(that's 10 characters wide and 10 characters tall). Although it would be
nice to implement an API for users to specify the dimensions of their
canvas, assume that another developer will be responsible for that.

## Notes

Rectangles can overlap with one another. The most recently added rectangle
should appear on top of other rectangles. For example:

```
  0123456789
0 ++++
1 ++.....
2 ++.....
3   .....
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

Make sure you do not render any characters that are out of bounds.

Otherwise, feel free to make smart decisions.
